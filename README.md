```bash
cd app
```

2. Execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
- Main script: [app/main.py](app/main.py)
- Input data: [input/](input/)
- Output files:
  - [output/p2-q-1.txt](output/p2-q-1.txt)
  - [output/p2-q-2.txt](output/p2-q-2.txt)
  - [output/p2-q-3.txt](output/p2-q-3.txt)
  - [output/p2-q-4.txt](output/p2-q-4.txt)
  - [output/p2-q-5.txt](output/p2-q-5.txt)
